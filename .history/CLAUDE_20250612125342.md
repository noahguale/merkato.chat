# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- **Development server**: `npm run dev` - Start Next.js development server
- **Build**: `npm run build` - Build the production version
- **Start production**: `npm run start` - Start production server
- **Lint**: `npm run lint` - Run ESLint checks

## Problem

This project is for a hackathon in creating a clone of a popular AI Chat App called T3Chat. T3Chat is similar to ChatGPT and Claude, but improves the functionality with improved speeds of getting responses and the use of multiple models.

## Core Features

- [ ] Authentication & Sync
  - [ ] **Convex** will handle authentication and db sync
  - [ ] **@vercel/ai-sdk** will handle SSE connection to the client
- [ ] Chat with Various LLMs
  - [ ] **@vercel/ai-sdk** will handle AI requests to models

## Additional Features

- [ ] Recent threads saved on localstorage (client)
  - [ ] Not sure yet
- [ ] Thread titles and tags generated
  - [ ] Gemini Flash 2.0 can summarize threads and add custom tags
- [ ] Thread search with filters with tags
- [ ] Syntax Highlighting
  - [ ] Users can add custom prettier styling in settings
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] CTRL + N for example would create a new thread
- [ ] Attachment Support
- [ ] Bring Your Own Keys

## Architecture Overview

This is a multi-provider AI chat application built with Next.js 15, Convex as the backend/database, and the AI SDK for streaming chat functionality.

### Core Architecture Components

1. **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TailwindCSS v4, and shadcn/ui components
2. **Backend**: Convex for real-time database, authentication, and serverless functions
3. **AI Integration**: AI SDK (`@ai-sdk/react`) with support for multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter)
4. **Authentication**: Convex Auth with support for external providers
5. **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state (AI model selection)

### Key Data Models (Convex Schema)

- **threads**: Chat conversations with metadata (title, model, pinned status, branch relationships)
- **messages**: Individual chat messages with role, content, status, and model information
- **providerConfigs**: Encrypted API key storage for different AI providers
- **attachments**: File attachments for messages

### AI Provider System

The app supports multiple AI providers through a unified interface:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo
- **Google**: Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **OpenRouter**: DeepSeek and other models

API keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption (`lib/encryption.ts`) and stored in the `providerConfigs` table.

### Key Directories

- `app/`: Next.js 15 app router pages and API routes
- `app/api/chat/route.ts`: Main chat API endpoint that handles streaming responses
- `convex/`: Convex backend functions, schema, and auth configuration
- `components/ui/ai/`: Specialized AI chat UI components (message, input, response)
- `lib/`: Utility functions for encryption, model definitions, and providers
- `store/`: Zustand stores for client state management

### Chat Flow

1. User input captured by AI SDK's `useChat` hook
2. Messages saved to Convex database via `createMessage` mutation
3. Chat API route (`/api/chat/route.ts`) handles streaming with proper provider/model selection
4. Encrypted API keys retrieved from Convex and decrypted for provider authentication
5. Streaming responses handled by AI SDK and displayed in real-time

### Environment Variables Required

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`: Convex deployment URL
- `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`: For Convex deployments
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: 64-character hex string for API key encryption

### Component Architecture

The UI uses a custom AI-focused component system built on shadcn/ui:

- `AIMessage`/`AIMessageContent`: Message display components
- `AIInput`/`AIInputTextarea`: Chat input with toolbar
- `AIInputModelSelect`: Model selection dropdown
- Provider-specific model definitions in `store/ai-model-store.ts`

### Authentication Flow

Uses Convex Auth with external provider support. User sessions managed through Convex's built-in auth system with JWT tokens for API route authentication.
